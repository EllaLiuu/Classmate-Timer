# Classmate's Timer Creative Coding Challenge
Contains my refactored version of classmate's Timer coding challenge. To view click [here](https://ellaliuu.github.io/Classmate-Timer/timer/)

My classmate's coding session was based off Professor Dan Shiffman's [Coding Challenge #66: JavaScript Countdown Timer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLtAMg9_Svw)

**What I did to refactor the program:**
* Added an input and button which prompted the user to input the time they wanted for the timer instead of having a fixed amount
* Added a text saying "Times Up!" when the timer reached 0
